If that happens, however, the arbitration provisions in this Section 2.13.9 will still be fully enforceable as to all other Claims, which must be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis. Any arbitrable Claims will be resolved before non-arbitrable Claims, which the parties will jointly request to be stayed pending the conclusion of arbitration.\n" +
                "2.13.9.3. Exceptions and Opt-Out.

Equitable Remedies**.** Except for individual Claims brought in small claims court, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any Claim asserted by you or the Crib Companies, and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual Claim. To the extent that you or the Crib Companies prevail on a Claim in arbitration and seek injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the general public, the entitlement and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, subject to Section 2.13.8 and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual Claims in arbitration.\n" +
